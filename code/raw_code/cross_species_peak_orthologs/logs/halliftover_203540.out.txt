Source species Human.
Target species Rhesus.
Output dir is ../../../data/raw_data/multiSpeciesOrthologs/halper.
NarrowPeak file is ../../../data/raw_data/multiSpeciesOrthologs/peaks/HumanMergedOrthologs.Interneuron.narrowPeak.gz.
Converting narrowpeak file to bed file. Make sure has unique peak name in 4th column.
Extracting narrowPeak summits to halLiftover.
Lifting Human summits to Rhesus genome.
Lifting Human peaks to Rhesus genome.
Apply HALPER to identify 1-1 orthologous in the Rhesus genome.
Done.
