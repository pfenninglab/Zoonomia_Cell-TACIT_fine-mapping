Output dir is ../../../data/raw_data/hg38/Corces_2020/halper.
NarrowPeak file is ../../../data/raw_data/hg38/Corces_2020/peak/Corces2020_caudate.MSN_D2.narrowPeak.gz.
Converting narrowpeak file to bed file. Make sure has unique peak name in 4th column.
Extracting narrowPeak summits to halLiftover.
Lifting Human summits to Mouse genome.
The file ../../../data/raw_data/hg38/Corces_2020/halper/Corces2020_caudate.MSN_D2_HumanToMouse_halLiftover.sFile.bed.gz exist without permission to overwrite.
Unzipping and using the previous halliftover sFile.
Lifting Human peaks to Mouse genome.
The file ../../../data/raw_data/hg38/Corces_2020/halper/Corces2020_caudate.MSN_D2_HumanToMouse_halLiftover.tFile.bed exist without permission to overwrite.
Unzipping and using the previous halliftover tFile.
Apply HALPER to identify 1-1 orthologous in the Mouse genome.
Done.
