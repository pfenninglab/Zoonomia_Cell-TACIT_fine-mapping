Source species Rhesus.
Target species Mouse.
Output dir is ../../../data/raw_data/rheMac10/Stauffer_caudate/halper.
NarrowPeak file is ../../../data/raw_data/rheMac10/Stauffer_caudate/peak/Stauffer_caudate.Interneuron.narrowPeak.gz.
Converting narrowpeak file to bed file. Make sure has unique peak name in 4th column.
Extracting narrowPeak summits to halLiftover.
Lifting Rhesus summits to Mouse genome.
Lifting Rhesus peaks to Mouse genome.
Apply HALPER to identify 1-1 orthologous in the Mouse genome.
Done.
