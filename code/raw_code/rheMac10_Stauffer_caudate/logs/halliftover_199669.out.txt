NarrowPeak file is ../../../data/raw_data/rheMac10/Stauffer_caudate/peak/Stauffer_caudate.Microglia.narrowPeak.
Overwrite intermediate halLiftover files.
Converting narrowpeak file to bed file. Make sure has unique peak name in 4th column.
Extracting narrowPeak summits to halLiftover.
Lifting Rhesus summits to Human genome.
Lifting Rhesus peaks to Human genome.
Apply HALPER to identify 1-1 orthologous in the Human genome.
Done.
